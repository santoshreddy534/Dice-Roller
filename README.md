DICE ROLLER


Developed a fun and interactive JavaScript dice roller application. Users can specify the number of dice to roll and their sides (e.g., six-sided dice) to generate random results. Perfect for board games, role-playing games, or just a bit of playful chance!

Features:

Multiple Dice Rolling: Throw any number of dice (within reasonable limits) simultaneously.

Customizable Dice Sides: Specify the number of sides for each die (e.g., d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20).

Clear Results: View the individual roll results for each die and the total sum.

User-Friendly Interface: The interface (details depend on your implementation) makes rolling dice a breeze.
